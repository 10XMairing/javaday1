#### Before trying to execute the java code make sure you have java installed properly in your system.

to check type `java` and `javac` in your cmd prompt or terminal. It should show some instructions.

if you dont look up how to install java and set `PATH` variables in Youtube/Google: can also refer (here)[https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-set-path-in-java]

Steps to Run :

navigate to your working directory using cmd refer here (command-prompt-navigation)[https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands]

for eg `cd Documents/myfolder/` . myFolder is your project dir where your Main.java is located

in vs code. you have an inbuilt terminal which you can use. its always set to its working dir by default

To manually run the code:

- Step 1 : Compilation Step

in your terminal(cmd must be at navigated to your working dir)

`javac Main.java`

This will create a java byte code in the same folder named as `Main.class`

- Step 2 : Running the compiled code

in your terminal(cmd must be at navigated to your working dir)

`java Main`

This will run your compiled byte code `Main.class` and execute your java program.
